# OnlyTasteful

A cook book for the modern cook. This project is a solution to keeping one's recipes in a basic note taking
app. This is a purpose built app for collecting recipes, modifying them, noting changes you've tried, ect.

## Getting Started

Simply clone the client and server to your local machine and run `npm start` to get a local instance up and running. See the server side README.md for details on how to get that up and running locally.

## Running the tests

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

## Deployment

### `npm run deploy`
This will run the predeploy and deploy scripts to get the project up on zeit.co.

## Built With

* [React](https://reactjs.org/) - The web framework used

## Authors

* **Michael H Ploughman** - *Initial work* - [Evoxus](https://github.com/Evoxus)

## Acknowledgments

* Thinkful

 * This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Other Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
